### ⚠️ ABOUT ME

Hello, I am Andrea, aka silver978, an indie game designer and developer. 😄 

I create inspirational horror games but I am open to any genre. 

Worked on [#LUISOAC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1742930/Looking_Up_I_See_Only_A_Ceiling/) and now developing its DLC "The Relapse". 

Recently, I am experimenting with new game styles. 

Stay tuned!
