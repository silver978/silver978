### Hi there 👋

Hello, I am Andrea, aka silver978, an indie game designer and developer. 😄 
I create inspirational horror games but I am open to any genre. 
Worked on [#LUISOAC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1742930/Looking_Up_I_See_Only_A_Ceiling/) and now developing its DLC "The Relapse". 
Recently, I am experimenting with new game styles. 
Stay tuned!
